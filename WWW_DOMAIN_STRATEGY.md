# WWW Domain Strategy - Best Practices

## ðŸ¤” **Your Question: WWW vs Non-WWW**

You're absolutely right! Many successful companies use www, and it's a perfectly valid choice.

## ðŸ“Š **Real-World Examples**

### Companies Using WWW:

- **www.facebook.com** - Social media giant
- **www.linkedin.com** - Professional network
- **www.amazon.com** - E-commerce leader
- **www.microsoft.com** - Tech giant
- **www.salesforce.com** - CRM leader
- **www.adobe.com** - Creative software
- **www.oracle.com** - Enterprise software

### Companies Using Non-WWW:

- **google.com** - Search engine
- **github.com** - Developer platform
- **netflix.com** - Streaming service
- **spotify.com** - Music streaming
- **slack.com** - Communication tool

## âœ… **Both Are Valid - Consistency Matters**

**The key insight**: It doesn't matter which you choose, but you must:

1. **Pick one** as your primary domain
2. **Redirect the other** with 301 (permanent) redirects
3. **Use it consistently** everywhere

## ðŸš¨ **Your Real Problem: Redirect Type**

Looking at your Vercel configuration, the issue isn't www vs non-www. It's the **redirect type**:

**Current (Problematic)**:

```
openautomate.io â†’ www.openautomate.io (307 Temporary)
```

**Fixed (SEO-Friendly)**:

```
openautomate.io â†’ www.openautomate.io (301 Permanent)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Strategy: Keep WWW**

Since you prefer www (which is great!), let's optimize for that:

### 1. **Vercel Configuration**

- **Primary Domain**: `www.openautomate.io` âœ…
- **Redirect**: `openautomate.io` â†’ `www.openautomate.io` (301 Permanent) âœ…

### 2. **Environment Variables**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.openautomate.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=https://cloud.openautomate.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.openautomate.io
```

### 3. **Google Search Console**

- Add both domains: `openautomate.io` and `www.openautomate.io`
- Set **preferred domain**: `www.openautomate.io`
- Submit sitemap: `https://www.openautomate.io/sitemap.xml`

## ðŸ”§ **How to Fix in Vercel**

In your Vercel dashboard (based on your screenshot):

1. **Keep current setup** but change redirect type:

   - Primary: `www.openautomate.io` âœ… (Keep this)
   - Redirect: Change from "307 Temporary" to "301 Permanent"

2. **Look for dropdown** where it says "307 Temporary" and change to "301 Permanent"

## ðŸ§ª **Testing After Fix**

```bash
# Should return 301 Permanent Redirect (not 307)
curl -I https://openautomate.io
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: https://www.openautomate.io/

# Should return 200 OK
curl -I https://www.openautomate.io
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## ðŸ“ˆ **Why WWW Can Be Better**

### Technical Advantages:

1. **Cookie isolation** - Can set cookies on subdomains without affecting main domain
2. **CDN flexibility** - Easier to point to different servers
3. **DNS management** - More flexible subdomain routing
4. **Legacy compatibility** - Some older systems expect www

### Brand Advantages:

1. **Professional appearance** - Many users expect www
2. **Clear web identity** - Explicitly identifies as a website
3. **Marketing consistency** - Easier to say "www dot company dot com"

## ðŸŽ¯ **Your Action Plan**

### Immediate (Today):

1. **Change Vercel redirect** from 307 to 301
2. **Create `.env.local`** with www domain
3. **Deploy updated code**

### This Week:

1. **Update Google Search Console** to prefer www
2. **Resubmit sitemap** with www URLs
3. **Request indexing** for key www pages

### Monitor (2-4 weeks):

1. **Check indexing progress** in Search Console
2. **Monitor organic traffic** growth
3. **Verify no redirect errors**

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Insight**

Your choice of www is perfectly fine! Companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Amazon use www and dominate search results. The problem was never the www - it was the temporary redirect type that confused Google.

## âœ… **Success Metrics**

After fixing the redirect type, you should see:

- **No more "Page with redirect" errors**
- **Faster Google indexing**
- **Better search rankings**
- **Increased organic traffic**

**Bottom Line**: Keep www.openautomate.io as your primary domain, just fix the redirect type from 307 to 301, and you'll solve the indexing issues while maintaining your preferred domain structure.
