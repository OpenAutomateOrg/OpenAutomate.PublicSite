# Google Indexing Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Domain Redirect Problem

**Root Cause**: Your site has a redirect from `openautomate.io` ‚Üí `www.openautomate.io` at the hosting level (Vercel). This is causing Google Search Console to report "Page with redirect" issues, preventing proper indexing.

**Current Status**:

- ‚ùå `https://openautomate.io` ‚Üí `https://www.openautomate.io` (307 Temporary Redirect)
- ‚úÖ `https://www.openautomate.io` ‚Üí Returns 200 OK

**Impact**: Google cannot properly index pages because they're behind redirects.

## üîç Why `site:openautomate.io` Shows No Results

This is normal for new websites, but the redirect issue is making it worse. Google indexing can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, but redirects significantly slow this process.

## ‚è∞ Typical Indexing Timeline

- **New Domain**: 1-4 weeks for first indexing
- **Established Domain**: 1-7 days for new pages
- **High Authority Domain**: Hours to 1-2 days

## üîß URGENT: Fix Domain Redirect Issue

### Step 1: Fix Vercel Domain Configuration

**In your Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to **Domains** section
3. **Current setup** (causing the problem):

   - Primary domain: `www.openautomate.io`
   - Redirect: `openautomate.io` ‚Üí `www.openautomate.io`

4. **Fix by choosing ONE approach:**

**Option A: Use openautomate.io as primary (RECOMMENDED)**

- Set `openautomate.io` as primary domain
- Set `www.openautomate.io` to redirect to `openautomate.io`

**Option B: Use www.openautomate.io as primary**

- Keep current setup but update all your configurations to use www

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables (if choosing Option A)

Update your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://openautomate.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=https://cloud.openautomate.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.openautomate.io
```

### Step 3: Google Search Console Actions

1. **Add BOTH domains** to Google Search Console:

   - `openautomate.io`
   - `www.openautomate.io`

2. **Set preferred domain** in Search Console
3. **Resubmit sitemap** with correct domain
4. **Request re-indexing** of key pages

## üöÄ Immediate Actions to Accelerate Indexing

### 1. Verify Google Search Console Setup

Check your Google Search Console:

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Ensure `openautomate.io` is added and verified
3. Check for any verification issues

### 2. Submit Individual URLs for Indexing

In Google Search Console:

1. Go to **URL Inspection** tool
2. Enter your homepage: `https://openautomate.io`
3. Click **Request Indexing**
4. Repeat for key pages:
   - `https://openautomate.io/about`
   - `https://openautomate.io/contact`
   - `https://openautomate.io/guide`

### 3. Verify Sitemap Status

1. In Google Search Console, go to **Sitemaps**

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://openautomate.io/sitemap.xml
