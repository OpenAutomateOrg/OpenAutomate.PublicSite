# Google Indexing Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Why `site:openautomate.io` Shows No Results

This is normal for new websites or recently launched domains. Google indexing can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on various factors.

## üö® HTTP vs HTTPS Issue

The "Referring page: http://openautomate.io/" in Google Search Console indicates a **mixed protocol issue**. This means somewhere your site is referencing HTTP instead of HTTPS, which can confuse search engines.

## ‚è∞ Typical Indexing Timeline

- **New Domain**: 1-4 weeks for first indexing
- **Established Domain**: 1-7 days for new pages
- **High Authority Domain**: Hours to 1-2 days

## üîß Fix HTTP/HTTPS Mixed Protocol Issue

### 1. Verify Your Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file uses HTTPS:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://openautomate.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=https://cloud.openautomate.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.openautomate.io
```

### 2. Check Server Configuration

Ensure your hosting provider/server:

- Forces HTTPS redirects
- Has a valid SSL certificate
- Doesn't serve any content over HTTP

### 3. Clear Google Search Console Cache

1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Use **URL Inspection** tool
3. Enter `https://openautomate.io` (with HTTPS)
4. Click **Request Indexing**

### 4. Resubmit Sitemap

1. In Google Search Console ‚Üí **Sitemaps**
2. Remove the old sitemap if present
3. Add: `https://openautomate.io/sitemap.xml` (ensure HTTPS)

## üöÄ Immediate Actions to Accelerate Indexing

### 1. Verify Google Search Console Setup

Check your Google Search Console:

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Ensure `openautomate.io` is added and verified
3. Check for any verification issues

### 2. Submit Individual URLs for Indexing

In Google Search Console:

1. Go to **URL Inspection** tool
2. Enter your homepage: `https://openautomate.io`
3. Click **Request Indexing**
4. Repeat for key pages:
   - `https://openautomate.io/about`
   - `https://openautomate.io/contact`
   - `https://openautomate.io/guide`

### 3. Verify Sitemap Status

1. In Google Search Console, go to **Sitemaps**
2. Check if `https://openautomate.io/sitemap.xml` is submitted
3. Look for any errors or warnings
4. Verify the sitemap shows discovered/indexed URLs

### 4. Check Robots.txt

Verify your robots.txt isn't blocking Google:

```bash
# Test your robots.txt
curl https://openautomate.io/robots.txt
```

Should show:

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://openautomate.io/sitemap.xml
```

## üîß Technical Checks

```
